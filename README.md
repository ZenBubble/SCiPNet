## But how do dar work?
We use the wonderfully made SCP Data API made by tedivm, which can be found here https://scp-data.tedivm.com/. We use this API for quick navigation, but when on an individual SCP page, SCiPNet uses the SkrapeIt library for advanced css shenanigans, just how the creator wants it to be viewed.
